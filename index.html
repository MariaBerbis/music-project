      <strong>R&B music:</strong> A very popular and wide-ranging style of
      music that emerged from traditional rythm and blues in the 1940s. R&B
      can be characterized by its use of blues chords played over a strong and
      consistent backbeat and by its emphasis on composition rather than the
      improvisation common in traditional blues. Hip hop, rap, soul, and disco
      are all categories of R&B. This music style also formed the foundation
      of rock and roll.
